    "privacy.intro": "ReKindle is a web application designed to provide a dashboard for E-ink devices. We prioritize your privacy and transparency.",
    "privacy.section.1.title": "1. Data Architecture",
    "privacy.section.1.body": "<p>ReKindle operates in two modes:</p><ul><li><strong>Guest Mode:</strong> All data is stored locally in your browser's Local Storage. Nothing is sent to our servers. If you clear your browser cache, this data is lost.</li><li><strong>Logged In Mode:</strong> Data for supported apps is synced securely to Google Firebase (Firestore & Realtime Database) under your unique User ID. This allows you to access your data across multiple devices.</li></ul>",
    "privacy.section.2.title": "2. Google User Data (Gmail, Tasks, Calendar, Contacts)",
    "privacy.section.2.body": "<p>ReKindle offers integration with Google services to display your personal data on your device. This feature is optional.</p><ul><li><strong>Gmail (Restricted Scope):</strong> If enabled, ReKindle accesses your Gmail messages to allow you to read, compose, archive, delete, and send emails directly from the dashboard. This uses restricted scopes to provide full mail management functionality.</li><li><strong>Access:</strong> The app requests access to your Google data only after you explicitly click \"Log In\" (in the specific app or settings) and grant permission via Google's secure OAuth 2.0 protocol.</li><li><strong>Usage:</strong> This data is fetched directly from Google's servers to your device's browser. It is used solely for display and editing within the ReKindle dashboard.</li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> Your Google Mail, Tasks, Calendar Events, and Contacts are <strong>not</strong> stored on our Firebase servers. Temporary access tokens are stored in your browser's Local Storage to maintain your session.</li><li><strong>Retention & Deletion:</strong> We adhere to a strict policy of data minimization. Since Google User Data is not stored on our persistent servers, there is no long-term retention. Data is cached locally in your browser for the duration of your session and is <strong>deleted immediately</strong> upon logging out or clearing your browser cache. You may revoke ReKindle's access at any time via your Google Account security settings, which will immediately cease our ability to display this data.</li><li><strong>Sharing:</strong> We do not share your Google user data with any third parties.</li></ul><p><em>ReKindle's use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google APIs will adhere to <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color:black;\">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>, including the Limited Use requirements.</em></p>",
    "privacy.section.3.title": "3. Data Protection Mechanisms",
    "privacy.section.3.body": "<p>We employ industry-standard security measures to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of your sensitive data.</p><ul><li><strong>Encryption in Transit:</strong> All data transmitted between your device, our servers, And third-party services (including Google APIs) is encrypted using <strong>Transport Layer Security (TLS/SSL)</strong>.</li><li><strong>Encryption at Rest:</strong> Any data synced to our database (as detailed in Section 4) is hosted on Google Firebase (Firestore & Realtime Database), which encrypts data at rest using <strong>256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256)</strong>.</li><li><strong>Secure Access:</strong> Access to personal data is restricted to the authenticated user. We use secure tokens (OAuth 2.0) to manage authorization without storing your actual Google password.</li></ul>",
